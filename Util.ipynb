        "The function get_music_notes() maps the frequency in hertz to each key on a standard saxophone. Within the function, a list named octave holds the names of keys in musical notation, distinguishing between uppercase for natural notes and lowercase for their corresponding sharps or flats. Setting the base_freq variable to 440 Hz establishes a reference point, specifically the frequency of the note A4. The function then constructs an array called keys, encompassing all possible combinations of note names and octave numbers across the saxophone's range. It then prunes this array to adhere to the standard 88 key piano scale, ensuring compatibility with conventional musical instruments. The function then generates note_freqs, a dictionary mapping each key to its respective frequency, calculated according to the equal tempered scale formula, which maintains consistent intervals between adjacent notes. Additionally, a placeholder with a frequency of 0.0 is appended to the dictionary, serving as a termination signal."

Inside the function, it computes frequencies for overtones based on the provided saxophone factors, ensuring they don't exceed half the sample rate to prevent distortion. Corresponding amplitudes for overtones are also determined, scaled by the saxophone factors. The fundamental sine wave is first generated, then subsequent overtones are added iteratively to it.

With parameters including the input waveform, sample rate, and durations for each phase of the envelope, it provides fine grained control over the dynamic characteristics of the audio signal. Inside the function, the lengths of each envelope phase are calculated in samples based on the provided times and sample rate. Subsequently, an empty array is initialised to store the ADSR envelope. The envelope is then constructed by smoothly transitioning between different amplitude levels during the attack, decay, and release phases, while maintaining a constant level during the sustain phase. Finally, the envelope is applied to the input waveform through element wise multiplication, resulting in a modulated waveform that exhibits the desired amplitude changes over time."
